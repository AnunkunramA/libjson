libjson
====

A standalone JSON parser library. Written when there were few standlone
libraries written in C that did not suffer from serious bugs and/or grave
performance issues, this code was used for several years by a handful of
proprietary servers that used JSON as a transport encoding. It also performed
double-duty as a JSON compressor and syntax checker. Ultimately supplanted by
a better open source library.
